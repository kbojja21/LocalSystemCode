<h3><a name="his and stru"></a>Textual history and structure</h3>
<p>The epic is traditionally ascribed to the sage Vyasa, who is also a major character in the epic.
 Vyasa described it as being itihāsa (history). He also describes the Guru-shishya parampara, 
 which traces all great teachers and their students of the Vedic times.
 The first section of the Mahabharata states that it was Ganesha who wrote down the text to Vyasa's dictation.
 Ganesha is said to have agreed to write it only if Vyasa never paused in his recitation. Vyasa agrees on
 condition that Ganesha takes the time to understand what was said before writing it down.
 The epic employs the story within a story structure, otherwise known as frametales, popular in many 
 Indian religious and non-religious works. It is recited by the sage Vaisampayana, a disciple of Vyasa,
 to the King Janamejaya who is the great-grandson of the Pandava prince Arjuna. The story is then recited 
 again by a professional storyteller named Ugrasrava Sauti, many years later, to an assemblage of sages 
 performing the 12-year sacrifice for the king Saunaka Kulapati in the Naimisha Forest.
 The text has been described by some early 20th-century western Indologists as unstructured and chaotic.
 Hermann Oldenberg supposed that the original poem must once have carried an immense "tragic force" but dismissed the full
 text as a "horrible chaos."[12] Moritz Winternitz (Geschichte der indischen Literatur 1909) considered that "only unpoetical 
 theologists and clumsy scribes" could have lumped the parts of disparate origin into an unordered whole.[13]</p>

<h3><a name="accr and red"></a>Accretion and redaction</h3>
<p>Research on the Mahabharata has put an enormous effort into recognizing and dating layers within the text.
 Some elements of the present Mahabharata can be traced back to Vedic times.[14] The background to the Mahabharata
 suggests the origin of the epic occurs "after the very early Vedic period" and before "the first Indian 'empire' was
 to rise in the third century B.C." That this is "a date not too far removed from the 8th or 9th century B.C."[4][15]
 is likely. Mahabharata started as an orally-transmitted tale of the charioteer bards.[16] It is generally agreed that
 "Unlike the Vedas, which have to be preserved letter-perfect, the epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably
 conform to changes in language and style,"[15] so the earliest 'surviving' components of this dynamic text are believed to
 be no older than the earliest 'external' references we have to the epic, which may include an allusion in Panini's 4th 
 century BCE grammar Ashtādhyāyī 4:2:56.[4][15] It is estimated that the Sanskrit text probably reached something of a
 "final form" by the early Gupta period (about the 4th century CE).[15] Vishnu Sukthankar, editor of the first great
 critical edition of the Mahabharata, commented: "It is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally 
 original shape, on the basis of an archetype and a stemma codicum. What then is possible? Our objective can only be to
 reconstruct the oldest form of the text which it is possible to reach on the basis of the manuscript material
 available."[17] That manuscript evidence is somewhat late, given its material composition and the climate of India,
 but it is very extensive</p>

 <h3><a name="old generations"></a>The older generations</h3>
 <p>Shantanu has two sons by Satyavati, Chitrāngada and Vichitravirya. Upon Shantanu's death, Chitrangada becomes king. 
 He lives a very short uneventful life and dies. Vichitravirya, the younger son, rules Hastinapura. Meanwhile, the King
 of Kāśī arranges a swayamvara for his three daughters, neglecting to invite the royal family of Hastinapur. In order 
 to arrange the marriage of young Vichitravirya, Bhishma attends the swayamvara of the three princesses Amba, Ambika 
 and Ambalika, uninvited, and proceeds to abduct them. Ambika and Ambalika consent to be married to Vichitravirya.</p>
